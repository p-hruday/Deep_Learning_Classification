## Introduction
This project aims to build and evaluate machine learning and deep learning models to address a specific predictive task. The notebook contains a comprehensive workflow, starting from data exploration to saving artifacts for deployment or further usage.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains multiple features relevant to the predictive task. A separate Word document is provided to explain each column's representation in the dataset. Key highlights:
- **Features**: (e.g., Demographics, Behavioral Data)
- **Target**: Binary classification or regression target variable

Ensure to review the Word document for a detailed understanding of the datasetâ€™s structure.

## Project Workflow
The project workflow is structured into eight main sections:
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Model Development
5. Hyperparameter Tuning
6. Model Evaluation
7. Neural Network Model Evaluation
8. Saving Artifacts

## Detailed Section Descriptions

### 4.1 Data Exploration
Purpose: To load and understand the structure of the dataset.
- Used libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to load the dataset.
- Inspected data for missing values, data types, and unique distributions.

### 4.2 Data Preprocessing
Purpose: To prepare the data for analysis and modeling.
- Handled missing values through imputation or deletion.
- Encoded categorical variables using appropriate methods (e.g., One-Hot Encoding).
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for unbiased evaluation.

### 4.3 Exploratory Data Analysis
Purpose: To uncover patterns and relationships within the data.
- Visualized feature distributions using histograms and scatterplots.
- Analyzed correlations using heatmaps.
- Identified outliers using box plots.

### 4.4 Model Development
Purpose: To develop machine learning models.
- Implemented Random Forest as the baseline model.
- Trained the model on the training set.

### 4.5 Hyperparameter Tuning
Purpose: To optimize model performance.
- Used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the Random Forest and SVM models.
- Evaluated performance using cross-validation.

### 4.6 Model Evaluation
Purpose: To measure model performance.
- **Random Forest**:
  - Best Parameters: `{'max_depth': 10, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 100}`
